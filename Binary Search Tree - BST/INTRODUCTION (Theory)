BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST)
    A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree with rule:
          - Left subtree → values less than the node
          - Right subtree → values greater than the node
          - This rule applies recursively to every node

## BST Properties 

- Ordering : All nodes in the left subtree are smaller, not just the immediate child.
- Inorder traversal is sorted - Left → Root → Right always produces increasing order.
- Search path is deterministic - At every node, comparison decides left or right. No backtracking.
- A BST gives fast operations only if height stays logarithmic.
---

## Time Complexity 

Let `h` = height of tree.
* Search → O(h)
* Insert → O(h)
* Delete → O(h)

- Best / Average case  :Balanced BST → h ≈ log n
- Worst case : Skewed BST → h ≈ n (Becomes a linked list)
- Traversal (any order) → O(n) always.
---

## Structural Behavior 

- Shape depends on insertion order
- Sorted input → worst case tree
- Random input → roughly balanced tree
- BST does not self-balance by default.
---

## Deletion Rules:

When deleting a node:
  1. No child → delete directly
  2. One child → replace node with child
  3. Two children → Replace with inorder successor (min in right subtree) Or inorder predecessor (max in left subtree)
---

## Traversals:
  - Inorder → sorted output
  - Preorder → recreate BST
  - Postorder → safe deletion
  - Level order has no BST advantage.
---

## When to use BST :
  * Need sorted data
  * Need range queries
  * Need ordered traversal
  * Insert/delete frequent
