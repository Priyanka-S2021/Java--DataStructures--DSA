BINARY TREE:
	• It is a non linear data structure to store data.
  • It has two children/Nodes - left child and right child.
	
PROPERTIES OF TREE:
    ○ Root - start node - important to traverse or track
		○ Parent - child
		○ Leaf node - Last node
		○ Siblings - relation between two leaf nodes or between left and right child of a root.
		○ Ancestors and desendents
		○ Size- no of nodes.
		○ Edges - link between two nodes.
		○ Height - maximum no of edges bw two nodes  (ie from particular node to leaf node)
		○ Level - diference of heigth bw root and particular node  (level of root node is always 0)
	

	TYPES:

	 • On the basis of level / height completion:
			§ Complete Binary Tree  -- two child or no child  - used in compression/segmentation
			§ Perfect Binary Tree -- all leaf node must be at same level
			§ Balanced Binary Tree
			§ Height balanced tree
			§ Skewed Binary Trees (like linkedlist)
			§ Ordered BT --all node has same property (like BST)
			
		

	• Binary Tree can be classified into the following special types:

		○ Binary Search Tree
		○ AVL Tree
		○ Red Black Tree
		○ B Tree
		○ B+ Tree

	

WHY TREE?

	• Insert /remove/ traverse in - O(logn)
	• Cost efficient as less time complexity for operations
	

ORDER:

	• INORDER: Left Root Right
	• PREORDER: Root Left Right
	• POSTORDER: Left Right Root

	• Inorder,preorder, postorder-- we use recursion
	• Level order --iteration with help of queue data structure


Application:

	• File systems 
	• Databases
	• Networking algorithms
	• Maths equations representation
	• Decision tress in ML
	• Image/ file compression- huffman coding


HINTS:

	• Trees can be solved in two ways:
		○ Recursion = stack is hidden
		○ Iteration = you manage the stack yourself
	• For height or longest path -[DFS] - Post order
  • For breath or to go level by level -[BFS] - level order
  • Tree is a type of graph - directed acyclic graph
